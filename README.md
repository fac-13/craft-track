## Problem statement

Crafters need a way to keep track of what they make, so that they can confidently report their work to relevant partners.

## Our Solution

A web app for crafters where they can log and reliably store their work in once place, and view all previously logged work at a glance.

#### The aims of the solution:

* To allow crafters to focus on their work without worrying about potential inconsistencies in work-logging.

## User Journeys

* As a Juta Shoes Maker, I can log a new craft and view my previously logged crafts
